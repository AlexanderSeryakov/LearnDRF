# LearnDRF

This repository was created for various experiments and testing of the functionality of the Django Rest Framework, so that in further development I would have a dump with all sorts of blanks, solutions and the necessary pieces of code for quick use.

Also here I am trying to link the frontend and backend parts of the application.
